  -bugs-
    Tested, no obvious bugs.
    
  -fixed bugs-
    1.Fixed horizontal scrolling: Changed the width of class divider to auto instead of 100%.
    2.Fixed cursor not registering hover: properly bug (header, download button).
    3.Fixed See second comment: Website loads before header/footer 
      !\*Just a suggestion but this could be to do with the loading of the resources from other folders due to the automated header loading.
      !\*Automated header loading changed from JavaScript to HTML code.
    4.Fixed See Comment: the logo so that the image is not contorted when displayed on either a large screen or a small one.
      !\*Changed width from 100% to auto.
