  -bugs-
    1.Website loads before header/footer !\*Just a suggestion but this could be to do with the loading of the resources from other folders due to the automated header loading.
    2.Fix the logo so that the image is not contorted when displayed on either a large screen or a small one.
  -fixed bugs-
    1.Fixed horizontal scrolling: Changed the width of class divider to auto instead of 100%.
    2. Fixed cursor not registering hover properly bug, (header, download button) Noone knows how.
