          The PPG Committee is made up of a group of patients who provide
          support to the surgery and staff to foster improved communications
          between the Practice and Patients. It is run by a collection of about a dozen
          patients of assorted interests and professions in a Committee who meet once a
          month with the Practise Manager

  --To-do--
  ~ = Done
  !* = Comment

  -bugs-
    1.Website loads before header/footer !*Just a suggestion but this could be to do with the loading of the resources from other folders due to the automated header loading.
    2.Fix the logo so that the image is not contorted when displayed on either a large screen or a small one.
  -fixed bugs-
    1.Fixed horizontal scrolling: Changed the width of class divider to auto instead of 100%.
    2. Fixed cursor not registering hover properly bug, (header, download button) Noone knows how.
